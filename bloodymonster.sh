# Executes by Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, & Cellular. Satellite and other radios are untested as of 09/08/2025.
# Note: Payloads execute only AFTER "AVRCP Play" following a volume change
# Loading payload while audio playing requires a pause press then a play press again to execute payload (2x button press).
# Loading payload while audio paused requires a play/pause/play press to execute payload (3x button press).
# To run the same payload two or more times consecutively volume twist away from payload and back to payload must be performed to execute same payload again. 
# Payloads can also be executed by entering 'AVRCP Play' in name area of iOS device (iPhone, iPad) connected to iCloud of macOS target device or send bluetooth connection attempt to host/target from 
# user with AVRCP Play in name area. First name change to 'AVRCP Play' will execute payload but next name change to 'AVRCP Play' should add letters or numbers after to be logged in log 
# stream and execute payload as soon as name is changed (e.g. 'AVCRP Play Now').
# User can root in and run bloodymonster.sh on remote machine or bloodymonster.sh can run at startup.
# Sound must be played back on BloodyMonster Bluetooth device to register volume changes as payloads.
# Code may need to be altered to run on specific OS or file/folder system.
# Future Payloads, Payload pack ideas, and collaborations are welcome
# Run chmod +x bloodymonster.sh before starting
# Ctrl + C to exit
